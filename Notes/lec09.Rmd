## More on R packages

* Reference: R Packages online book https://r-pkgs.org/tests.html

* vignettes (chapter 11)
* testing (chapter 12)
* data (chapter 14) 



## Vignettes

*  A package vignette is long-form documentation that
teaches a user how to use all of the features of your package
    * Some packages have multiple vignettes to illustrate 
    different aspects of the package, but your mars package
    will have only one.
* These days, most vignettes are written in RMarkdown.
    * You can browse the RMarkdown source for my lecture notes on
    GitHub.

## Getting started with vignettes

* Use `usethis::use_vignette("mars")`

\scriptsize

```
> usethis::use_vignette("mars")
 Setting active project to '/Users/mcneney/Teaching/Stat360_2022/SFUStat360/mars'
 Adding 'knitr' to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION
 Setting VignetteBuilder field in DESCRIPTION to 'knitr'
 Adding 'inst/doc' to '.gitignore'
 Creating 'vignettes/'
 Adding '*.html', '*.R' to 'vignettes/.gitignore'
 Adding 'rmarkdown' to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION
 Writing 'vignettes/mars.Rmd'
 Modify 'vignettes/mars.Rmd'
```

## Draft RMarkdown document

* As noted, `use_vignette()` generates a template RMarkdown document
in the vignettes directory that you can edit.

\scriptsize

* See the RStudio Help -> Markdown Quick Reference and https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf
for help on RMarkdown.


## Sections of your mars package vignette

* See the project rubric for details.
    * Introduction to the MARS algorithm
    * Calling `mars()`
    * Illustration of the methods


## Testing

* Use `usethis::use_testthat()` to create a skeleton test suite 
for your package.
* `use_testthat()` prints messages to tell you what it's doing
and then suggests calling `use_test()` to generate a test file.
    * We will not use `use_test()`. Instead, in the week 9 exercises
    you will manually create test files.


\scriptsize

```
> usethis::use_testthat()
 Adding 'testthat' to Suggests field in DESCRIPTION
 Setting Config/testthat/edition field in DESCRIPTION to '3'
 Creating 'tests/testthat/'
 Writing 'tests/testthat.R'
 Call `use_test()` to initialize a basic test file and open it for editing.
```

## Example test file

* Test files should be saved in the `tests/testthat` folder and should:
    1. Load the package
    2. Load the .RData files in  that contain the expected output of
    the function(s) you are testing,
    3. Call `testthat::test_that()` to do the test.
        * `test_that()` takes a description of the test and 
        code (usually a call  to `expect_equal()`) to do the tests as arguments.
* `expect_equal()` takes two objects as input. The first (object) is the 
from running the function to be tested from the current version,
and the second (expectation) is the "right answer" from a previous version 
of the function that was known to work.
    * In general you have to generate and save expectations to your 
    `tests/testthat` folder, but in this class I have done that 
    for you.

\scriptsize

```
library(mars)
load("testsomething.RData") # contains an R object with the "right answer"
test_that("myfunc works properly",{
    # could have multiple lines/tests here in the expression between {}
    expect_equal(myfunc(myinput),testoutput)})
```

## Package datasets

* Datasets that you include with your package
may be taken from external sources (spreadsheets, text files, websites) or may be simulated. 
* The raw data source(s) and commands used to wrangle them into R objects should be stored in the `data-raw` directory of your package.
* Use `usethis::use_data_raw()` to get started and `usethis::use_data()`
to save your dataset.
    * See the week 9 exercises for an example.

\scriptsize
```
> usethhis::use_data_raw("marstestdata")
 Creating 'data-raw/'
 Adding '^data-raw$' to '.Rbuildignore'
 Writing 'data-raw/marstestdata.R'
 Modify 'data-raw/marstestdata.R'
 Finish the data preparation script in 'data-raw/marstestdata.R'
 Use `usethis::use_data()` to add prepared data to package
```

## Documenting datasets

* Datasets in data/ are exported and so much be documented.
* Use Roxygen2 comments in a dummy .R script in your `R/` folder.
* See the `Exercises/ProjectTestfiles/data.R` script in the 
class repository for an example.
    * You will need to copy this example to your R package.
