## Calling C++ from R with Rcpp

* R is written in C, and so in principle it is possible to write C/C++ code
that calls R and R code that calls C/C++.
    * Using R "internals" directly is complicated.
    * A base R function for passing R objects to C/C++ is `.Call`.
    * See the chapter "System and foreign language interfaces"
    in the "Writing R Extensions" manual. 
* Rcpp provides a more user-friendly interface with C++.
    * Allows you to write C++ functions that can be called from R
    * Use it to speed up code that runs too slowly in R.
    * Of the 17345 packages on CRAN, 2385 (or more) use Rcpp
* This is a brief intro; much more info at http://www.rcpp.org/ and 
elsewhere on the internet.
* Warning: This lecture will be too simplified for those with
C++ experience, and information overload for those without.

## Use cases

* Unavoidable loops (can't avoid by vectorizing).

* Many (e.g., millions) of function calls, such as in a recursive algorithm.
    * Less overhead in C++ compared to R.

* Require advanced data structures and algorithms that
are available in a C++ library, such as the Standard Template
Library( STL), but not in R.

* And many more ...

## Prerequisites

* Install and load the Rcpp package

\small

```{r}
# install.packages("Rcpp")
library(Rcpp)
```

\normalsize

* Install a working C++ compiler. To get it:
    * On Windows, install Rtools.
    * On Mac, install Xcode.
    * On Linux, `sudo apt-get install r-base-dev`
    

## Getting started (section 25.2)

* First example:

\small

```{r}
cppFunction('int add(int x, int y, int z) {
  int sum = x + y + z;
  return sum;
}')
# add works like a regular R function
add
add(1, 2, 3)
```

* Rcpp (i) compiles the C++ code (note lag) and (ii) constructs the 
R function `add()` that will call this compiled code.
* The above defines a function "inline"; it is also possible to "source" 
C++ code (more later).

## The plan


* Start simple and work up, writing functions with:
    * no inputs and a scalar output
    * scalar input and scalar output
    * vector input and scalar output
    * vector input and vector output
    * matrix input and vector output
* Keep an eye out for differences, such as the need to declare the 
type of objects.

## No inputs, scalar output

\small

* R:

```{r}
one <- function() 1L # recall that 1L is integer 1
```

* Rcpp (notice single quotes):

```{r}
cppFunction('int one() {
  return 1;
}')
one()
```

## C++ differences

* Donâ€™t use assignment to create functions.

* Declare the type of output the function returns; e.g., 
a scalar integer (`int`).


* C++ has true scalars, with types `double`, `int`, `String`, and `bool`.

* A return statement is **required**

* Every statement is terminated by a `;`.


## Scalar input and output

* A scalar version of the sign() function which returns 1, 0 or $-1$ for positive, zero or negative input:

\small

```{r}

signR <- function(x) {
  if (x > 0) { 1 } else if (x == 0) { 0 } else { -1 }
}

cppFunction('int signC(int x) {
  if (x > 0) {
    return 1;
  } else if (x == 0) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return -1;
  }
}')
signC(-100)
```

## Notes

* In addition to declaring the type of the output, we must
declare the type of the input.
* Logicals and `if`-`else` are the same.

## Vector input and scalar output


\footnotesize

```{r}
sumR <- function(x) {
  total <- 0
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    total <- total + x[i]
  }
  total
}
cppFunction('double sumC(NumericVector x) {
  int n = x.size();
  double total = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    total += x[i];
  }
  return total;
}')
```


##


\small

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(1e5)
bench::mark(sumR(x),sumC(x),sum(x)) # recall benchmarking pkg bench
```


## Notes

* The input in this example is of type `NumericVector`,
which is a C++ class defined by Rcpp.
    * Rcpp takes care of converting the R function input to `NumericVector`
    and the C++ function output to an R object
    * Other vector types are `IntegerVector`, `CharacterVector`, 
    and `LogicalVector`. 
* The `.size()` method of a vector returns the length as an integer.
* Notice the syntax of `for()`: `for(initial condn; check condn; increment)`. 
    * In this case we initialise by creating variable i with value 0. 
    * Before each iteration we check that `i < n`, and terminate if not. 
    * After each iteration, increment i by one, using `++`.

* C++ uses zero-based indexing, 0,...n-1 (!!!)

* `+=` increments "in-place"


## Vector input, vector output

* Note: In the following, `NumericVector out (n)` constructs a
`NumericVector` object of length `n`.

\scriptsize

```{r}
pdistR <- function(x, ys) { sqrt((x - ys) ^ 2) }
cppFunction('NumericVector pdistC(double x, NumericVector ys) {
  int n = ys.size();
  NumericVector out (n);

  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    out[i] = sqrt(pow(ys[i] - x, 2.0)); //  pow() vs ^{}
  }
  return out;
}')
pdistC(10,6:15)
try(pdistC(1:3, 6:15) )
```


## Copying with clone

* In R we use assignment to copy vectors.
* In C++ with Rcpp copy an existing vector with 
the `clone()` function; 
e.g., `NumericVector zs = clone(ys)`.

## Using sourceCpp

* For functions of more than a few lines it is more convenient to 
define them in a source file and use `sourceCpp()`
to link them to R. 
* Source files must end in `.cpp` and start with the header

\scriptsize

```
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;
```

\normalsize

* The `File -> New File -> C++ file` feature of RStudio 
generates a skeleton to get you started; see `lec10_1.cpp`.

\scriptsize

```{r}
sourceCpp("lec10_1.cpp") # See source file
timesTwo(3:6)
```

## Other classes (Section 25.3)

* Rcpp provides wrappers to other base data type.
* The text focusses on lists/data frames, functions and attributes.

## List input, including S3 classes

* Generally more useful for output than input, because C++ needs to
know classes of list components in advance.
* For use as input, you can convert components to C++ equivalents with `as()`.
    * See the source file `lec10_2.cpp` for the following example.

\footnotesize

```{r}
sourceCpp("lec10_2.cpp") 
mod <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
mpe(mod) # function defined in lec10_2.cpp
```

## Aside: Primer on C++ templates

* Few details here, just a few words so we recognize
function and class templates when we see them.
* C++ template functions allow programmers to write code that 
takes a generic argument. 
    * A template function `func<T>()` takes template 
    parameter `T` that can be the type of the function inputs and/or output. 
    For a given `T`, the compiler generates a function specific to that type. 
    * Examples: `as<NumericVector>(SEXP R)` is a function that 
    takes an R expression (SEXP) as input and returns
    a `NumericVector`; `as<CharacterVector>(SEXP R)` returns
    a `CharacterVector`; etc.
* Data structures can also be templated; e.g., the 
C++ Standard Template Library (STL) defines a `vector` class
that is like a generic container, with methods for inserting, re-sizing, etc. 
    * You can create a vector of `int`s with `vector<int>`, etc.
* Defining your own template functions and classes 
is beyond the scope of this class.

## Functions

* So far we have been using Rcpp to call 
C++ functions from R, but we can also call R functions from C++.
* Use type `Function` to input R functions and type `RObject` to
hold general input/output.

\footnotesize

```{r}
sourceCpp("lec10_3.cpp") # see source file
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)
callFunction(x,fivenum)

callWithOne(function(x) x+1)

fit <- lm_in_C(formula(mpg~disp),mtcars,lm)
summary(fit)$coef
```


## A warning from the Rcpp developers

* Occasional R function calls from C++ are OK, but don't call repeatedly.

*  From https://gallery.rcpp.org/articles/r-function-from-c++/ :

\scriptsize

\begin{quote}
Calling a function is simple and tempting. It is also slow as there are overheads involved. And calling it repeatedly from inside your C++ code, possibly buried within several loops, is outright silly. This has to be slower than equivalent C++ code, and even slower than just the R code (because of the marshalling of data). Do it when it makes sense, and not simply because it is available.
\end{quote}

\normalsize

* Consider instead accessing R functionality from the GNU Scientific Library https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html 
*via* the RcppGSL package, or one of the 50 or so other 
Rcpp* C/C++ library interfaces.

## Attributes

* In R we get and set attributes with `attr()`; e.g.,

\scriptsize

```{r}
out <- c(1,2,3)
names(out) <- c("a","b","c")
attr(out,"my-attr") <- "my-value"
attr(out,"class") <- "my-class" # or class(out) <- "my-class"
out
```

## Attributes with Rcpp

* From Rcpp, get and set R object attributes
with the `.names()` and .attr()` methods for  vector types.
   
\scriptsize

```{r}
sourceCpp("lec10_4.cpp") # see source file
attribs()
```



## C++ Standard Template Library (Section 25.5)

* References: Text, section 25.5, and  https://www.cppreference.com/Cpp_STL_ReferenceManual.pdf
* Rcpp gives us access to the data structures and algorithms 
provided by C++ libraries like the Standard Template Library (STL).
* We'll cover some STL basics.
    * Data structures
    * Iterators
    * Algorithms
* The theme of the STL is abstraction: Implementations of
algorithms encapsulate the logic and operate on generic data structures
that we think of as "containers", capable of holding any kind of data.
* Note: Many of the data structures and algorithms that originated
in the STL have made their way into the C++ Standard Library; this
is true of all of those used in this lecture.

## Lists in R are generic containers

* In R, lists can be thought of as generic containers that
generalize atomic vectors to hold arbitrary data structures.

![Lists as generic containers](list.png){width=40%}

* In R, list elements can be accessed by index, 
in the same way as vectors (in fact, we 
refer to lists as vectors); this is called "random access".

## Container performance tradoffs

* The STL offers different containers with different 
performance characteristics. For example:
    * vectors allow fast random access, but are slow for insertion/deletion
    * lists (not R lists) allow fast insertion/deletion, but access
    to elements requires traversal of the container, starting at one end.
* Unlike R lists, STL vector and list elements must be of the same type.
    * E.G., create a vector of integers of length 9 with 
    `vector<int> myvec (9)`
    * Rcpp data structures like `NumericVector` are essentially
    typed STL vectors (`NumericVector` is `vector<double>`).
* Algorithms can be written to work on multiple container types
by abstracting how we access elements. The abstraction is
called an iterator.


## Using iterators

* We will use the following three features of iterators:
    1. Advance with `++` or `--`.
    2. Get the value they refer to, or dereference, with `*`.
    3. Compare with `==` and `!=`.

* The following code snippets compare a sum function that uses
indexing to one that uses an iterator to loop over the vector.

\tiny

```
#include <Rcpp.h>
using namespace Rcpp;
// [[Rcpp::export]]
double sumC(NumericVector x) {
  int n = x.size();
  double total = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
    total += x[i];
  }
  return total;
}
// [[Rcpp::export]]
double sum3(NumericVector x) {
  double total = 0;
  NumericVector::iterator it;
  for(it = x.begin(); it != x.end(); ++it) {
    total += *it;
  }
  return total;
}
```

## 

* At any given time, the iterator will "refer" (point) to an element of the
container. 
* We initialize to refer to the first element of the 
container `x` with `x.begin()` and will stop iterating when 
the iterator refers to the last element `x.end()`.
* `++it` advances the iterator to refer to the next element
of the container.
* `*it` gets the container element that `it` currently 
refers to.

## Algorithms

* Algorithms in the STL often input or output iterators.
* The script `lec10_5.cpp` gives an example from the text.
    * Implements R's `findInterval()` function that takes
    a numeric vector `x` and vector of breakpoints `breaks` as input
    and returns the bin defined by `breaks` that each element of `x` is in.

\scriptsize

```{r}
sourceCpp("lec10_5.cpp")
findInterval2(x=c(-1.5,-.5,.5,1.5),breaks=c(-1,0,1))
```

##

* Iterates over input `x` with iterator `it` and over output vector `out`
with iterator `out_it`.
    * Call `upper_bound()` algorithm from the STL (also in C++ Std Lib)
    to search `breaks` for the first element 
    greater than `*it`. `upper_bound()` returns an iterator `pos`
    over the vector `breaks`.
    * Calculate bin (interval) number as distance from start of 
    `breaks` to `pos`.
    
## Case Studies (Section 25.6)

* See the Gibbs sampler and vectorization examples in Section 25.6 
of the text
* We'll do a different case study. 

## Case Study: Metropolis algorithm

* The Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm is an important tool
for drawing (dependent) samples from a distribution known
only up to a constant.
    * A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that
    reinvigorated Bayesian statistics in the early 2000s.
    * We will implement a simplified version of the MH 
    algorithm known as the Metroplois algorithm.
* Reference for this demo is Matthew Stephens' "Five Minute Stats" site:
    * Introduction to the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \scriptsize https://stephens999.github.io/fiveMinuteStats/MH_intro.html \normalsize
    * Example implementations in R \scriptsize
    https://stephens999.github.io/fiveMinuteStats/MH-examples1.html 

## Example Metropolis algorithm

* Problem: sample from an exponential distribution with 
mean 1.
    * Simple illustration -- we know how to do this without MCMC.
* R code to implement the algorithm is as follows

\scriptsize

```{r}
target = function(x){
  if(x<0){ return(0) } else { return( exp(-x))}
}
easyMCMC_R = function(niter, startval, proposalsd){
  x = rep(0,niter)
  x[1] = startval     
  for(i in 2:niter){
    currentx = x[i-1]
    proposedx = rnorm(1,mean=currentx,sd=proposalsd) 
    A = target(proposedx)/target(currentx)
    if(runif(1)<A){
      x[i] = proposedx #accept move with probability min(1,A)
    } else {
      x[i] = currentx #otherwise "reject" move, and stay where we are
    }
  }
  return(x)
}
```


## Test out easyMCMC

\scriptsize

```{r,fig.height=5}
set.seed(123)
N <- 1000; startval <- 3; proposalsd <- 1
z1=easyMCMC_R(N,startval,proposalsd)
hist(z1,nclass=50,freq=FALSE,xlim=c(0,6.5))
xx <- seq(from=0.01,to=6,length=100)
lines(xx,exp(-xx),col="red")
```

## Rcpp version

\scriptsize

```{r,fig.height=5}
sourceCpp("lec10_MCMC.cpp") 
z2 <- easyMCMC_C(N,startval,proposalsd)
hist(z2,nclass=50,freq=FALSE,xlim=c(0,6.5))
lines(xx,exp(-xx),col="red")
```

## Benchmark the two implementations

* The C++ version runs about 20 times faster.
* For more complex problems, MCMC algorithms need to run 
for millions of iterations, so 20-times speedup is good
(think one day *vs* three weeks run-time).

\scriptsize

```{r}
bench::mark(easyMCMC_R(N,startval,proposalsd),
            easyMCMC_C(N,startval,proposalsd),
            check=FALSE) # don't check equality of function calls
```

## Compare to R's `rexp()` random exponential generator

\scriptsize

```{r,fig.height=5}
z3 <- rexp(1000)
hist(z3,nclass=50,freq=FALSE,xlim=c(0,6.5))
lines(xx,exp(-xx),col="red")
```



## Rcpp in R packages (Section 25.7)

* Your .cpp files can also be included in a package.
* Call `devtools::use_rcpp()` from your package's RStudio project
to get started
    * Compiled code goes in a `src` directory.
    * Rcpp is added to the "Imports" and "LinkingTo" fields of the 
    DESCRIPTION file.
    * And more ...
