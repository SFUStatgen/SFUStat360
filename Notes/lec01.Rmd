# Course Objectives

## Course objectives

- Work through the book Advanced R by Hadley Wickham: https://adv-r.hadley.nz/index.html
- R objects: names and values
- Basic data structures and programming.
    * vectors, subsetting, control flow, functions, environments
    * No tidyverse this time
- Object-oriented programming in R
- Code performance: debugging, profiling, memory, calling 
Python, C or ++ from R
- Parallelizing R code (if time permits)

## Getting started with R, RStudio and git

- Follow the ``getting started'' instructions on the class canvas 
page to get set up with R, RStudio and git.
    * R and RStudio will be familiar, but you may not have used git
    before, so leave some time for that.
- Please try to get R and RStudio installed and 
create an RStudio project linked to the class GitHub 
repository as soon as possible.
- Those still having trouble after the weekend should ask our TA, Pulindu,
for help during the first lab sessions in week 2. 


## Reading 

- Welcome, Preface and Chapter 1 of the text.

# R objects: names and values

## R objects

- In R, data structures and functions are all referred to 
as "objects".
- Objects are created with the assignment operator `<-`; e.g.,  
`x <- c(1,2,3)`.
    - The objects a user creates from the R console are contained in
    the user's workspace, called the global environment. 
    - Use `ls()` to see a list of all objects in the workspace. 
    - Use `rm(x)` to remove object `x` from the workspace.

## Names and values

- Reference: text, chapter 2
- The description on the previous slide of `x <- c(1,2,3)` is
an over-simplification. 
- It is more accurate to say we've done two things: (i) created
an object in computer memory 
that contains 1, 2, 3 and (ii) "bound" that object to the 
"name" `x`.

\small

```{r}
# install.packages("lobstr")
library(lobstr)
x <- c(1,2,3)
ls()
obj_addr(x) # changes every time this code chunk is run
```

\normalsize

## Syntactic *vs* non-syntactic

* Valid, or "syntactic" names in R can consist of letters, digits, . 
and _ but should start with a letter.
* Names that start with . are hidden from directory listing with `ls()`.
* Names that start with _ or a digit are non-syntactic and will cause
an error.
* If you need to create or access a non-syntatic name, use backward
single-quotes ("backticks").

\small

```{r}
x <- 1
.x <- 1
`_x` <- 1
ls()
```



## Modifying, copying, binding

* Mofifying a variable causes a copy to be made.

\footnotesize

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3); y <- x
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
x[[2]] <- 10 # Note: x[2] <- 10 has the same effect
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
x
y
```

## Tracing copying

* The `tracemem()` function marks an object so that a message is printed
whenever a copy is made.

\small

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3)
tracemem(x)
x[[2]] <- 10
x <- 5 # removes the trace on the object
x[[1]] <- 1
```

## More on `tracmem()`

* As the output of `tracemem()` suggests, 
the trace is on the object, not the name:

\small

```{r}
x <- c(1,2,3)
tracemem(x)
y <- x
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
y[[2]] <- 10
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
```


## Function calls

* R has a reputation for passing copies to functions, but in fact the
copy-on-modify applies to functions too:

\footnotesize

```{r}
f <- function(arg) { return(arg) }
x <- c(1,2,3)
y <- f(x) # no copy made
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
f <- function(arg) { arg <- 2*arg; return(arg) }
y <- f(x) # copy made
c(obj_addr(x),obj_addr(y))
```

## Lists

* List elements point to objects too:

\footnotesize


```{r}
l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)
c(obj_addr(l1),obj_addr(l1[[1]]),obj_addr(l1[[2]]),obj_addr(l1[[3]]))
# Note: ref(l1) will print a nicely formatted version of the above,
# but doesn't work with my slides
```

## Copy-on-modify in lists

* As you would expect, we only copy the list **elements** that
are modified, rather than the entire list.
    * `tracemem()` flags **any** change to the list

\footnotesize

```{r}
l1 <- list(c(1,2), c(3,4), c(5,6,7))
c(obj_addr(l1),obj_addr(l1[[1]]),obj_addr(l1[[2]]),obj_addr(l1[[3]]))
tracemem(l1)
l1[[1]] <- 55
c(obj_addr(l1),obj_addr(l1[[1]]),obj_addr(l1[[2]]),obj_addr(l1[[3]]))
```

## Copies of lists are "shallow"

\footnotesize

```{r}
l2 <- l1
l2[[3]] <- 111
c(obj_addr(l1),obj_addr(l1[[1]]),obj_addr(l1[[2]]),obj_addr(l1[[3]]))
c(obj_addr(l2),obj_addr(l2[[1]]),obj_addr(l2[[2]]),obj_addr(l2[[3]]))
```


## Data frames are lists ...

\footnotesize

```{r}
dd <- data.frame(x=1:3,y=4:6)
c(obj_addr(dd[[1]]),obj_addr(dd[[2]]))
dd[,2] <- 7:9
c(obj_addr(dd[[1]]),obj_addr(dd[[2]]))
dd[1,] <- c(11,22)
c(obj_addr(dd[[1]]),obj_addr(dd[[2]]))
dd[1,2] <- 111
c(obj_addr(dd[[1]]),obj_addr(dd[[2]]))
```

## Beware of data frame overhead

* Data frames are convenient, but the convenience comes at a cost.
    * Can illustrate by tracing copying when we modify columns.

\footnotesize

```{r}
dd <- data.frame(x=rnorm(100)) # try yourself with rnorm(1e7)
tracemem(dd)
dmed <- lapply(dd,median)
dd[[1]] <- dd[[1]] - dmed[[1]] # same as dd[,1] - dmed[[1]]
```

##

* Fewer copies if we do the same with a list.

\footnotesize

```{r}
ll <- list(x=rnorm(100))
tracemem(ll)
lmed <- lapply(ll,median)
ll[[1]] <- ll[[1]] - dmed[[1]]
```


## Modify-in-place

* The text claims two exceptions to the copy-on-modify, but
in my experiments environments are the only one:

![environments](env1.png){width=40%} ![environments](env2.png){width=40%}

\footnotesize

```{r}
e1 <- rlang::env(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
e2 <- e1
e1$c <- 4
e2$c
```
